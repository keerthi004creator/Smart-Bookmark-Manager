Problems Faced & Solutions

1. Problem:I initially struggled with Next.js as I didn’t have much knowledge about it.  
   Solution: I took help from ChatGPT and guidance from my brother to understand the framework line by line, which made it easier to implement features.

2. Problem: I had no prior experience with Supabase and didn’t know how to set up tables or interact with the database.  
   Solution: By following step-by-step guidance, I learned how to create tables and manage data in Supabase successfully.

3. Problem: Google OAuth was also new to me and I didn’t know how to integrate it for login functionality.  
   Solution: With external help and careful study, I understood the authentication flow and implemented Google login in my project.

Through persistence and learning, I overcame these challenges and successfully completed the project.

 How to Use / Run the Project
1. Login using your Google account.  
2. Add bookmarks by entering a title and URL.  
3. Edit bookmarks to update the title or URL.  
4. Delete bookmarks that are no longer needed.
